	<h1>You are the Research Director!</h1>
	<p><img src="rd.png"/></p>
	<p>You are the head of research on <b>The Captain's</b> station.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are a head of staff.</b></p>
	<p>Your primary role is overseeing <b>Scientists</b>, <b>Roboticists</b> and, to a lesser extent, <b>Exploration Crew</b> and <b>Geneticists</b> in research and development of new science and technologies.</p>
	<p><img src="ai.gif"/> As the <b>Research Director</b>, you have both access to the <b><ins>AI Upload</ins></b> as well as the <b><ins>Robotics Consoles</ins></b></p>

	<p><img src="borg.png"/>Utilize the former to <b>reset an AI</b> that has been either given incorrect laws, or hit by an <b>Ion Storm</b>.
	<p><img src="robo.png"/>The latter may be used to either disable a <b>Rogue Mech</b>, or lockdown a <b>Rogue Cyborg</b><p>
	<p>Ensure that your science team is working to actively upgrade the machinery around the station with freshly researched parts. Your department is the bleeding edge.</p>
	<p>While your team are highly trained professionals, it is still good procedure to check that nothing dangerous in your department gets out of hand.</p>
	<p><img src="traitor.png"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but you are <b>not</b> a Security Officer. Allow them to be the station's first line of defense.</p>
	<p>In the event that there is no active Captain, you may be expected to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b> and take on that role.</p>
	<p>If you need to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b>, you will need to secure the <ins><b>Nuclear Authentication Disk</b></ins> <img src="disk.png"/>found within the <b>Captain's Quarters</b>.</p>
	<p>Should the station situation become impossible to handle, you have access to the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b> to call an <b>Emergency Shuttle</b></p>

	<p><b>We are assured, <i>Research Director</i>, that you will avoid any Resonance Cascades.</p>
