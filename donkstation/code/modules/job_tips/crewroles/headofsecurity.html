	<h1>You are the Head of Security!</h1>
	<p><img src="hos.png"/></p>
	<p><b>The Captain</b> is trusting you to maintain law and order on their station.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are a head of staff.</b></p>
	<p>Your primary role is to manage your team of <b>Security Officers</b>, the <b>Warden</b> and the <b>Detective</b> as they maintain order within the station.</p>
	<p>While the <b>Brig Physician</b> and <b>Lawyer</b> are a part of Security, they are not expected to directly make arrests and have their own jobs.</p>
	<p>While you may go out into the field, teamwork is important for survival as your ID card and equipment are some of the most powerful on the station. <b>You are a target for Enemies of the Corporation</b></p>
	<p><img src="disabler.png"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but attempt to avoid collateral damage by using <b>non-lethal weapons</b> while possible.</p>
	<p><img src="handcuffs.png"/>As the <b>Head of Security</b>, you have final say on <b>Arrests</b>, <b>Permabrigging</b> and <b>Labour Camp</b> usage. <ins><b>Only the Captain may authorize Execution</b></ins> and pardon criminals.
	<p><img src="lasergun.png"/>In the event that a major, <b><ins>deadly</ins></b>, threat to the station's crew is found, arming Security with lethal weaponry from the Armoury may be required.</p>
	<p>In the event that there is no active Captain, you may be expected to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b> and take on that role. Allow other Heads of Staff to take first priority over you.</p>
	<p>If you need to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b>, you will need to secure the <ins><b>Nuclear Authentication Disk</b></ins> <img src="disk.png"/>found within the <b>Captain's Quarters</b>.</p>
	<p>Should the station situation become impossible to handle, you have access to the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b> to call an <b>Emergency Shuttle</b></p>
