	<h1>You are the Chief Engineer!</h1>
	<p><img src="ce.png"/></p>
	<p><b>The Captain</b> expects you to maintain the functionality of their station.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are a head of staff.</b></p>
	<p>Your primary role is managing your <b>Station Engineers</b> and <b>Atmospheric Technicans</b> to keep the station powered, repaired, breathable and in a working state.</p>
	<p><img src="supermatter.png"/> Your Engineering Team may or may not be aware of how to set up a source of power, one of your roles is to teach and <ins><b>ensure the safe setup of any engine.</ins></b></p>
	<p><img src="radio.png"/>As the <b>Chief Engineer</b>, you have access to <b><ins>Telecommunications</b></ins> in the event it requires repairs due to damages.<p>
	<p>In the event of a major atmospheric situation, your hardsuit is capable of handling <b>nearly all environmental hazards</b> for safe repairs and restoration of an area.</p>
	<p><img src="traitor.png"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but you are <b>not</b> a Security Officer. Allow them to be the station's first line of defense.</p>
	<p>In the event that there is no active Captain, you may be expected to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b> and take on that role.</p>
	<p>If you need to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b>, you will need to secure the <ins><b>Nuclear Authentication Disk</b></ins> <img src="disk.png"/>found within the <b>Captain's Quarters</b>.</p>
	<p>Should the station situation become impossible to handle, you have access to the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b> to call an <b>Emergency Shuttle</b></p>
