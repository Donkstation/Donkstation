	<h1>You are the Head of Personnel!</h1>
	<p><img src="hop.png"/></p>
	<p>You are the second in command under <b>The Captain</b></p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are a head of staff.</b></p>
	<p>Your primary role is ensuring that the crew have reasonable access to departments they need and overseeing the Supply and Service departments.</p>
	<p><img src="idconsole.png"/>Your ID card has access to <b><ins>modify the access of other IDs</ins></b> to allow job changes and extra department access.</p>
	<p>When possible, consult other Heads of Staff when providing a job change to a new department. Better they know they're getting a new employee.<p>
	<p><img src="id_gold.png"/> While you have full power to grant All-Access, you must only do so in the event of a critical emergency.</p>
	<p><img src="traitor.png"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but you are <b>not</b> a Security Officer. Allow them to be the station's first line of defense.</p>
	<p>In the event that there is no active Captain, you may be expected to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b> and take on that role.</p>
	<p>If you need to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b>, you will need to secure the <ins><b>Nuclear Authentication Disk</b></ins> <img src="disk.png"/>found within the <b>Captain's Quarters</b>.</p>
	<p>While your domain is the Supply and Service departments, they mostly manage themselves. Helping with communications between the two can make the station very rich, however.</p>
	<p>Should the station situation become impossible to handle, you have access to the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b> to call an <b>Emergency Shuttle</b></p>
