	<h1>You are the Detective!</h1>
	<p><img src="detective.png"/></p>
	<p><b>The Head of Security</b> has assigned you to this case.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are Security.</b></p>
	<p><img src="fedora.png"/>You're here to crack the case and figure out who did it. Leave the arrests to the rest of the team.</p>
	<p>Scan objects and doors at the scene of crimes with your <b>Forensic Scanner</b>, which can be used at a short distance away, to gather fibers and fingerprints.</p>
	<p>Once you have a set of prints and fibers, use your <b>Security Console</b> to figure out a potential perpetrator to undergo an arrest and search.</p>
	<p>While out in the field, communication is key. Make sure your fellow officers know your position in the event of suspicious activity. <b>You are a target for Enemies of the Corporation</b></p>
	<p><img src="handcuffs.png"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but your position is to <b>only</b> investigate crimes and arrest in the most dire of circumstances.</p>
	<p><img src="revolver.png"/>If there is a <ins>deadly</ins> threat to yourself or innocents, lethal force may be required to protect lives.</p>
