	<h1>You are the Chief Medical Officer</h1>
	<p><img src="cmo.png"/></p>
	<p><b>The Captain</b> is entrusting the health of the station's crew to you.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are a head of staff.</b></p>
	<p>Your main task is to manage <b>Medical Doctors</b>, <b>Chemists</b>, <b>Virologists</b> and, to a lesser extent, <b>Geneticists</b> and <b>Brig Physicians</b> in keeping the crew alive and well.</p>
	<p><img src="optable.gif"/> Various types of injuries will enter your <b>Medbay</b>, make sure your staff correctly diagnose and treat patients of <ins>various species</ins>.</p>
	<p><img src="computer.png"/>There is no shame in keeping reference materials on-hand to refer to while treating a patient.</b>.
	<p><img src="chemmaster.gif"/>Making sure that your <b>Chemists</b> create a <ins>supply of medicine of various types</ins> will ensure swift treatment of patients.</b><p>
	<p>In the event of a <b>Viral Outbreak</b>, <ins>isolation of infected</ins> is key to prevent a pandemic on the station.</p>
	<p>The <b>Virologist</b> or <b>Geneticist</b> may create useful things. Inspect the items in their labs before they are distributed.</p>
	<p><img src="traitor.png"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but you are <b>not</b> a Security Officer. Allow them to be the station's first line of defense.</p>
	<p>In the event that there is no active Captain, you may be expected to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b> and take on that role.</p>
	<p>If you need to become the <b><ins>Acting Captain</ins></b>, you will need to secure the <ins><b>Nuclear Authentication Disk</b></ins> <img src="disk.png"/>found within the <b>Captain's Quarters</b>.</p>
	<p>Should the station situation become impossible to handle, you have access to the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b> to call an <b>Emergency Shuttle</b></p>
