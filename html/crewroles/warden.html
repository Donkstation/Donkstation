	<h1>You are the Warden!</h1>
	<p><img src="warden.png"/></p>
	<p><b>The Head of Security</b>, your superior, expects you to secure his brig.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are Security.</b></p>
	<p>Your main purpose is to <b><ins>patrol the Security Wing</ins>, <ins>process prisoners</ins></b>, monitor cameras and to make sure Space Law is upheld.</p>
	<p>Working out in the field should only be a last resort, as leaving the <b>Brig</b> unguarded can be very dangerous.</p>
	<p>Communication is key, make sure your fellow officers know about suspicuous activity and put an arrest warrant out on any suspects.</p>
	<p>Remember, the <b><ins>Armoury</ins></b> is the most armed place on the station. <b>You are a target for Enemies of the Corporation</b> because of this.</p>
	<p><img src="stunbaton.gif"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, ensure that your team are equipped and able to respond effectively.</p>
	<p><img src="handcuffs.png"/>When brigging someone, make sure that the punishment is equal to the severity of the crime. A minor crime doesn't deserve ten minutes in the box.
	<p><img src="traitor.png"/>When a large enough threat is caught, you have the power to put them into the <b>Labor Camp</b> or <b>Permabrig</b>. <ins><b>Only the Captain may authorize Execution</b></ins></p>
	<p><img src="lasergun.png"/>If there is a <ins>deadly</ins> threat to the station itself, distribution of Armoury assets to the crew may be needed.</p>
