	<h1>You are the Security Officer!</h1>
	<p><img src="sec.png"/></p>
	<p><b>The Head of Security</b>, your superior, expects you to keep the law.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are Security.</b></p>
	<p>Your main job is to ensure the safety of the crew and that Space Law is upheld.</p>
	<p>While stunning and arresting criminals is part of the job, you should do what you can to help innocents. Recovery of injured can help just as much as a clown in a cell.</p>
	<p>When out in the field, communication is key. Make sure your fellow officers know your position in the event of suspicious activity. <b>You are a target for Enemies of the Corporation</b></p>
	<p>Work with your team, they each have their own unique skills. <b>Detectives</b> can search an area for evidence while <b>Wardens</b> can replace your equipment and monitor people.</p>
	<p><img src="stunbaton.gif"/>Threats to the crew and station may exist, but consider station alert levels and context when deciding to search or arrest.</p>
	<p><img src="handcuffs.png"/>When making arrests, make sure that any brig time is equal to the severity of the crime. A minor crime doesn't deserve ten minutes in the box.
	<p><img src="lasergun.png"/>If there is a <ins>deadly</ins> threat to yourself or innocents, lethal force may be required to protect lives.</p>
